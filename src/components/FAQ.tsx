    question: "Can I use tscircuit commercially?",
    answer:
      "You can use tscircuit for commercial purposes. tscircuit is under the same permissive MIT license as Node.js, React, and thousands of other popular projects you are likely already using! ",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I import designs from other software?",
    answer:
      "tscircuit has some support for importing designs from other software, but it's not yet fully featured. You should file an issue on our Github if you'd like to see a specific format supported.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use tscircuit locally?",
    answer:
      "Yes, you can use tscircuit locally using the tscircuit CLI, but we recommend starting with the web-based application for simplicity.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can tscircuit make schematics? Is it extra effort?",
    answer:
      "tscircuit always renders both a schematic and PCB. Unlike traditional EDA where the schematic capture and PCB layout are separate processes, tscircuit combines them by allowing a user to specify constraints and automations. This means that you can design a schematic and then immediately see a PCB layout or vice versa.",

    question: "What exactly is tscircuit?",

        <p className="mb-2">
          tscircuit is a <strong>React/TypeScript framework</strong> for
          designing electronic circuits programmatically.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Instead of using traditional graphical interfaces, you write code to
          define components, their connections, and layout constraints. This
          "electronics design as code" approach unlocks powerful capabilities
          like reusable packages, continuous automation, parameterization, and
          integration with modern software development workflows (like version
          control with Git).

        <p className="mb-2">
          While the core of tscircuit is the framework, the term "tscircuit"
          often refers to the broader <strong>ecosystem</strong> built around
          it. This includes:
